## What is it?

Terra-- is a fork of Terra++ intended to strip down dependencies to Minecraft and Forge so it can be used safely in as dependency for other projects (this is not a mod).

## How to use ?

### :warning: This project is still experimental

Just add the required maven repositories to your `build.gradle`, and declare Terraminusminus as a dependency.

I.e.:
```groovy
repositories {

    // Smyler's repository has the Terraminusminus builds
    maven {
        name = "Smyler Snapshots"
        url = "https://maven.smyler.net/snapshots/"
    }
    
    // Classic JCenter repository that has most of what we need
    jcenter()
    
    // JitPack is required to build some dependencies
    maven {
        name = "JitPack"
        url = "https://jitpack.io/"
    }
    
    // DaPorchop's repo for PorkLib
    maven {
        name = "DaPorkchop_"
        url = "https://maven.daporkchop.net/"
    }
    
    // This is for leveldb
    maven {
        name = "OpenCollab Snapshots"
        url = "https://repo.opencollab.dev/snapshot/"
    }
    
}

dependencies {

    // Include this repository as a dependency.
    // master-SNAPSHOT indicates to use the last commit built from master,
    // you can replace this with  a reference to another branch 
    compile 'net.buildtheart:terraminusminus:master-SNAPSHOT'
    
    // Your other dependencies would go down there...
}
```

### Release channels

At this point, only branch snapshots are available.
You can browse the available builds at [maven.smyler.net](https://maven.smyler.net/#/snapshots/net/buildtheearth/terraminusminus).
